# Precision calibration of wide-field radio instruments.

A transmitter mounted to a drone provides a known signal at a known location. High redshift 21cm experiments like EDGES, OVRO LWA or HERA are particularly sensitive to unexpected systematics in beam response. The goal for such experiments is to make fully polarized sky maps of antenna beams accurate to 1% across the instrument bandwidth. Such measurements also support a wider range of science applications including stellar activity, exoplanets, planetary magnetospheres, and cosmic ray observatories. [More](/about/)

The method paper answers many common questions. (Jacobs et al 2017, [journal](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASP..129c5002J/abstract), [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02607))

# Open Source project
A secondary goal is to build a community resource for drone-based radio calibration.
