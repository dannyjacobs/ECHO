## External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories

The aim of the ECHO project is high precision calibration of wide-field radio instruments. A transmitter mounted to a drone provides a known signal at a known location.  The goal is to make full sky maps of antenna beams accurate with variation everywhere less than 1%.  A secondary goal is to build an open source project useful as a community resource.

 * Codes for generating flight paths, combining standard drone logs and spectrometer outputs, and producing beam maps are on [github](https://github.com/dannyjacobs/echo)
 * Documentation on [readthedocs](https://external-calibrator-for-hydrogen-arrays-echo.readthedocs.io/)
 * [Memo series]( covers flights, build logs, and whatever else is worth reporting.
 * The method paper (Jacobs et al 2017) answers many frequently asked questions [pasp](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASP..129c5002J/abstract) [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02607)
