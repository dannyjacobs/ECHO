 **Whats the backstory to this project?**  
 The project began in 2012 at Arizona State University as a student powered instrumentation development. It has been supported by the National Science Foundation (AST-1407646, AST-1711179)

 **Do you buy drones or build your own?**  
  We have used both Commercial drones and custom builds. The current Mark 7 platform (ca 2019) is a custom build using kit parts. (build log in memo 51)

 **What kind of antenna do you use**  
 We use the [Aaronia Bicolog 5070](https://aaronia.com/antennas/bicolog-series-biconical). It is a calibrated biconical rated from 30MHz to 2GHz.  There are higher frequency models available. It is robust to abuse and has a very smooth frequency response.

 **How high do you fly?!**  
 We are limited by FAA regulations to a height of 400ft above ground. Much higher and one loses line of sight anyway.

 **How long can the drone stay up?**  
 Flight time: 45min hover, 30 minute mapping sorties

 **How do you mount everything?**  
 This is the main question! We're always making new mounts. They are generally 3D printed PLA and fixed beneath the drone between the legs.

 **Doesn't the presence of the drone distort the calibrator beam?**  
 Modeling suggests that proximity to the drone is not the dominant uncertainty in the drone beam.

 **Does the Mk7 battery really mount on top?**  
 Yes. This is somewhat novel for a battery of the size we're using, but despite seeming dreadfully unstable it works fine

 **What is the frequency Coverage?**  
 We've tested with tones at 137Mhz and at 70MHz. Eventually our goal range is 50 to 250MHz with at least 20MHz simultaneous coverage.

 **What is the drone position accuracy?**  
 We estimate 8cm uncertainty using RTK GPS. The actual positioning accuracy is less.

 **What transmitters do you use?**
   * Transmitter V1 used dual tone Valon 5009 VCO (23 - 6GHz).
   * TX V2 will add chopping.
   * TX V3 will add 20MHz band limited noise

 **Who does the flying?**  
 Danny is Part 107 certified pilot with 7 years, 45 hours on controller with a 100+ flights.

 **What is in your field kit?**  
 3 spare drones (essential!), 2 spare antennas, SAS542 folding bicone + stand for auxiliary receiver. The whole mess fits into 4 custom pelican cases.

 **How much does the drone build cost?**  
 The Mk7 cost ~$1200 each in parts in 2018
