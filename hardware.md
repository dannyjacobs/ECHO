# Drones
We have built and bought different drone platforms since 2012. Much has changed in
that time as companies come and go, new capabilities emerge, .  Currently we are using drone Mark 7, a custom build hexacopter based on power and frame kits from DJI. In testing drones Mk 1-6 we developed a set of requirements
  which are described in [memo 40](http://danielcjacobs.com/uploads/ECHO_Memos/ECHO040_ECHO_Drone_Requirements.pdf).

# Payload Mounts
We typically mount the payload (transmitter, filters, antenna) beneath the drone.  Most of the time we use 3D printed plastic. It is lightweight and rigid.  Solid model files are posted on [github](https://github.com/dannyjacobs/ECHO/blob/master/hardware/ECHO_hardware_summary.rst).


# Transmitters
 * [Valon 5009](https://www.valonrf.com/frequency-synthesizer-6ghz.html)
 * TituTx V1 (ASU custom, memo TBD)
